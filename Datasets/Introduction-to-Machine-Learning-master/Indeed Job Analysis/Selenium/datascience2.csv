Before you dive-in exploring this opportunity and press Apply, we wish you to evaluate yourself - We are looking for right candidate, not the best candidate. We love to work with someone who can mandatorily gel with our vision, beliefs, thoughts, methods, and values - which are aligned with what can be expected in a true startup with ambitious goals.


Skills are always secondary to us. Primarily, you must be someone who is not essentially looking for a job or career, rather starving for a challenge, you yourself probably don't know since when.


A book can be written on what an applicant must have before joining a . For brevity, in nutshell, we need these three in you:
You must be [super sharp] (Just an analogue, but Irodov, Mensa, Feynman, Polya, ACM, NIPS, ICAAC, BattleCode, DOTA etc should have been your Done stuff. Can you relate solution 1 to problem 2? or Do you get confused even when solved similar problem in past? Are you able to grasp problem statement in one go? or get hanged?)
You must be [extremely energetic] (Do you raise eyebrows when asked to stretch your limits, both in terms of complexity or extra hours to put in? What comes first in your mind, let's finish it today or this can be done tomorrow too? Its Friday 10 PM at work -Tired?)
You must be [honourably honest] (Do you tell others what you think, or what they want to hear? Later is good for sales team for their customers, not for this role. Are you honest with your work? intrinsically with yourself first?)


You know yourself the best. If not ask your loved ones and then decide. We clearly need exceedingly motivated people with entrepreneurial traits, not employee mindset - not at all.


This is an immediate requirement. We shall have an accelerated interview process for fast closure - you would be required to be proactive and responsive.

R3. Must have implemented complex mathematical logics through functional map-reduce framework in Python
R4. Must have understanding on EDA cycle, machine learning algorithms, hyper-parameter optimization, ensemble learning, regularization, predictions - at essential level


Preferred
R5. Good to have ability to recognize code that is more parallel, and less memory constrained, and you must show how to apply best practices to avoid runtime issues and performance bottlenecks. You should be accountable for code written by you. No hit & trial.

Y2. Relevant experience of 0.5 - 3 years working on real-world problems in a reputed company or a proven startup
Y3. You are a fanatical implementer who love to spend time with codes & workarounds, more than your loved ones
Y4. You are true believer that human intelligence can be augmented through computer science & mathematics and your survival vinaigrette depends on getting the most from the data
Y5. You are an entrepreneur mindset with ownership, intellectuality, & creativity as way to work. These are not fancy words, we mean it

For us the customer is everything and we will stop at nothing to make their stay the best experience! We strongly believe that machine learning can help transform this experience for the user.

If the above problem statement excites you, then believe us when we say - we have not even scratched the surface yet!

Our process of joining the team is very simple. We look for people who
Are as motivated and crazy as we are.

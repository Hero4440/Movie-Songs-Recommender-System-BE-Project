Data Science,"Pune, Maharashtra",Emphire HR Services,,Organic,"A good understanding of statistics is vital as a data scientist. You should be familiar with statistical tests, distributions, maximum likelihood estimators, etc. This will also be the case for machine learning, but one of the more important aspects of your statistics knowledge will be understanding when different techniques are (or aren’t) a valid approach. Statistics is important at all company types, but especially data-driven companies where stakeholders will depend on your help to make decisions and design / evaluate experiments.
Machine Learning
If you’re at a large company with huge amounts of data, or working at a company where the product itself is especially data-driven (e.g. Netflix, Google Maps, Uber), it may be the case that you’ll want to be familiar with machine learning methods. This can mean things like k-nearest neighbors, random forests, ensemble methods, and more. It’s true that a lot of these techniques can be implemented using R or Python libraries—because of this, it’s not necessary to become an expert on how the algorithms work. More important is to understand the broad strokes and really understand when it is appropriate to use different techniques.

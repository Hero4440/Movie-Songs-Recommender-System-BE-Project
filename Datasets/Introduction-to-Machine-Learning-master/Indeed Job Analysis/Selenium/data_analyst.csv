We know that we will lose and win almost equally during initial stages but with knowledge and experience, we will definitely improve this ratio. This is what we want all employees to feel about and challenge themselves to improve.
What should an ideal candidate have for this position?
Total commitment and always trying to challenge her/his own and others’ ideas to make the overall system/process produce a better result. We value the integrity most and we don’t compromise on that.
